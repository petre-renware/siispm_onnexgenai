* @idea... to create anchors in doc (for bid item # ref for example) use __`<a name="abcd"></a>`__ (as here `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6695439/how-to-link-to-a-named-anchor-in-multimarkdown`) - try in system landscape component c1 (& ATTN this doc should be treated as part of System Landscape when make references) - #NOTE: RESOLUTION @230923: OK. WORKS. you need to know the `#...` string and to apply it manually to route - __NOT RECOMMENDED__ ==> the text will become "heavy" & unreadable
